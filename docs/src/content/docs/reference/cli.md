## no-mistakes

Attach to the active pipeline run for the current branch when one exists. If none exists, bare `no-mistakes` can start the setup wizard to create a branch, commit changes, push through the gate, wait for the daemon to register the new run, and then attach. If the push succeeds but no run is registered, that wizard path now exits with an explicit error instead of silently falling through. By default this wizard path is interactive and only runs in a TTY session. In non-interactive contexts, bare `no-mistakes` falls back to showing the last 5 runs inline unless you pass `-y` or `--yes` to run the wizard and accept defaults automatically. When a TTY is available, `-y` keeps the wizard visible, shows a brief `waiting for run…` state after push, and auto-advances the default path; without a TTY it falls back to the headless path.

```sh
no-mistakes
no-mistakes --skip test,lint
```

| Flag          | Type     | Default | Description                                          |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `-y`, `--yes` | `bool`   | `false` | Run setup wizard and accept defaults automatically   |
| `--skip`      | `string` | (none)  | Comma-separated pipeline steps to skip for a new run |

Unlike `no-mistakes attach`, bare `no-mistakes` only auto-attaches to an active run on the current branch.
`--skip` only applies when bare `no-mistakes` starts a new pipeline run through the wizard; it does not skip a step on an already-active run.
Valid step names are `intent`, `rebase`, `review`, `test`, `document`, `lint`, `push`, `pr`, and `ci`.

## no-mistakes init

Initialize or refresh the gate for the current repository.

`init` requires an `origin` remote to identify the upstream repository: later pipeline steps push validated branches to the configured target and open pull requests against that upstream. If `origin` is missing, add it with `git remote add origin <url>`, replacing `<url>` with the upstream repository's URL, then re-run `init`.

```sh
no-mistakes init
no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:you/my-repo.git
no-mistakes init --worktree-root ~/work/my-repo-runs
```

| Flag              | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--fork-url`      | `string` | (none)  | GitHub fork remote URL to push branches to while opening PRs against `origin`                  |
| `--worktree-root` | `string` | (none)  | Directory to create this repository's run worktrees in; prints the `worktree_roots` entry to add |

Creates or refreshes a local bare repo, installs the managed pre-receive admission and post-receive notification hooks, best-effort isolates the gate repo's hook path from shared git config changes when Git supports `config --worktree`, adds or repairs the `no-mistakes` git remote, detects the default branch, records or updates the repo in SQLite, installs the `/no-mistakes` agent skill at user level into `~/.claude/skills/no-mistakes/SKILL.md` and `~/.agents/skills/no-mistakes/SKILL.md`, and ensures the daemon is running, installing the managed service when available and falling back to a detached daemon otherwise.
`init` writes no skill files into the repo; the user-level copies serve Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills`) and agents that use the vendor-neutral `~/.agents/skills` convention (Codex, OpenCode, Rovo Dev, and Pi) across all repos. Grok Build is a pipeline runner and does not consume this installed skill.
If the home `.claude` links to `.agents`, `.claude/skills` links to `.agents/skills`, or the reverse, `init` follows that layout and still makes the skill readable from both logical paths.
If the repo still contains a vendored skill copy written by an older no-mistakes version, `init` leaves it untouched and prints a notice that it is no longer needed and can be removed.
The gate advertises Git push-option support, so you can skip steps for one push with `git push -o no-mistakes.skip=test,lint no-mistakes <branch>`.

For GitHub fork contributions, keep `origin` pointed at the parent repository and pass `--fork-url` with your fork remote URL.
The Push step and rebase branch-sync use the fork, including when CI repair restarts validation and reaches Push again, while GitHub PR and CI commands stay scoped to the parent repository and create PRs with `--head <fork-owner>:<branch>`.
Fork routing currently requires both `origin` and `--fork-url` to be GitHub remotes with owner/repo paths.

`--worktree-root` is for directory-scoped toolchain configuration (mise, direnv), which resolves by path ancestry and so never reaches a run worktree under `NM_HOME`.
The flag resolves the directory, then prints the [`worktree_roots`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#worktree_roots) entry to add to `~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml`; the global config is hand-maintained, so `init` never rewrites it for you.
When the file already has a `worktree_roots:` block, `init` prints just the entry line to add under it - a second `worktree_roots:` key would make the config unparseable and stop the daemon.
Runs are created at `<dir>/<run id>` once the entry is in place; no-mistakes only ever touches the directories its own run records name, and everything else in that directory is left alone.
`init` rejects the directories the daemon would refuse to start on, so the entry it prints is always one you can paste: a directory inside `NM_HOME`, inside the repository being initialized or any other gated checkout, already used by another checkout (it names that checkout), or that exists as a non-directory.

Two refusals apply to every `init`, with or without the flag.
It refuses to register a checkout that contains a directory an existing [`worktree_roots`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#worktree_roots) entry points at, naming that entry, because registering it is what would make the placement unusable and stop the daemon; place the checkout elsewhere or repoint the entry first.
It also refuses to register anything while `~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml` does not load, naming the fault, because the daemon refuses to start on that same config.

Re-running `init` on an already-initialized repo succeeds and reports `Gate already initialized (refreshed)`.
It refreshes managed gate wiring, origin/default-branch metadata, hook-path isolation, and the installed agent skill, overwriting any stale `SKILL.md` content from an older binary.
When a fork URL is already recorded, re-running `init` without `--fork-url` preserves it.
Passing `--fork-url` again replaces the stored fork URL after validation.
If you rename or move an initialized working directory and the old path no longer exists, re-running `init` from the new path reattaches the existing gate, preserves the repo ID and run history, and updates the stored working path.
If you copy an initialized working directory while the original still exists, the copy is treated as a separate repo and gets a fresh gate.
Fresh init rolls back gate setup when a required gate or daemon step fails; refresh does not eject a pre-existing gate if daemon startup fails.
Skill installation is best-effort: if the skill write fails, init reports it and leaves the working gate in place.

## no-mistakes axi

Agent eXperience Interface for non-interactive agents.
Most agent workflows use the installed `/no-mistakes` skill, which drives this command surface underneath.
It prints TOON to stdout, prints progress to stderr, and uses structured stdout errors with exit code `1` for operational failures and `2` for bad usage.
At the TOON output boundary, unsupported C0 control bytes are rendered as visible `\xNN` escapes while tabs, carriage returns, newlines, printable Unicode, and the underlying durable logs remain unchanged.
If TOON encoding still fails, AXI prints a structured error instead of returning successful empty stdout.
The calling agent drives AXI approval gates but does not replace the configured pipeline agent that performs validation.

```sh
no-mistakes axi
```

With no subcommand, shows the executable path, description, repo, current branch, daemon state, recent runs, and next-step help, including a pointer to `no-mistakes axi run --help` and the installed `/no-mistakes` skill for full driving guidance.
When the current branch has an active run, that run appears as `active_run` with any approval gate and help for `axi respond` when it is parked or `axi status` when it is still running.
If an active run object is parked at a decision gate, it includes `awaiting_agent: parked <duration>` immediately after `status`.
That field is observability only; the `gate:` object still tells the agent which response to send.
If a step is actively `running` or `fixing`, the run object can also include an `active_steps` table with `active_for`, `last_activity`, native `agent_pid` when one is currently running, and the current execution or fix round.
When only another branch has an active run, that run appears as `other_branch_active_run`; the help tells agents to leave it alone and start validation for the current branch.
AXI help and outputs always repeat the preserve-prior-gate-progress contract: after a gate round has already produced fix commits, additional fixes belong on the same branch.
When a relevant `branch_sync` object is present, they also include version-matched synchronization guidance to follow before a post-pipeline local commit or fresh run.
Agents must not abort-and-restart, reset, replace the branch, or improvise Git recovery in a way that drops prior gate-fix commits.
A fresh run re-validates the current branch state, so already-resolved findings do not re-surface.

## no-mistakes axi run

Start or reattach to validation for the current branch, blocking until the first approval gate, CI-ready decision point, or final outcome.
An active run on another branch does not block starting validation for the current branch.

```sh
no-mistakes axi run --intent "the user's goal"
no-mistakes axi run --intent "the user's goal" --skip test,lint
no-mistakes axi run --intent "the user's goal" --yes
```

| Flag          | Type     | Default | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--intent`    | `string` | (none)  | What the user set out to accomplish; required to start a new run |
| `-y`, `--yes` | `bool`   | `false` | Auto-resolve every gate until a decision point or outcome        |
| `--skip`      | `string` | (none)  | Comma-separated pipeline steps to skip                           |

`--intent` is not a description of the diff.
It is the user's goal or request, and no-mistakes uses it verbatim instead of transcript inference.
Err on the side of completeness: include the goal, important decisions and tradeoffs, constraints or approaches ruled in or out, and explicit requests that might otherwise look surprising in the diff.
When starting a new run, `axi run` refuses the default branch and uncommitted working trees with actionable errors instead of auto-branching or auto-committing.
Reattaching to an in-flight run does not require `--intent`.
Reattachment accepts either the run's immutable submitted head or its current pipeline head, so pipeline-created fix commits do not detach an unchanged submitting worktree.
When neither identity matches, `axi run` keeps the fresh-run path but refuses a gate push while `branch_sync` says the pipeline still owns the branch.
That refusal returns the complete structured state and its `continue_active_run` or `recover_custody` next action instead of a raw Git non-fast-forward.
Reattaching to an in-flight run can proceed while the daemon is already running even if the global config file has become invalid, but starting a fresh run still requires valid global config.
Starting a fresh run also requires a runnable effective pipeline agent.
If the configured native agent or ACP runner is unavailable, the run fails before any pipeline step starts instead of reporting command-only validation as a passed gate.
With `--yes`, `axi run` treats both `action: auto-fix` and `action: ask-user` findings as standing consent for the pipeline to fix them by selecting every finding, then accepts the resulting fix review.
Gates with no findings or only `action: no-op` findings are approved as-is, and each step is fixed at most once so unresolved findings do not loop forever.
Without `--yes`, an agent driving `axi run` should stop when a gate contains `action: ask-user` findings and relay each finding's ID, file, and full description to the user before responding.
Review gates include a `note` field reminding agents that `auto_fix.review` defaults to `0`, so blocking and ask-user review findings park for a decision unless configuration explicitly opts back into review auto-fix.
Long-running `axi run` calls are working, not stalled; if one returns a `gate:`, read that output and answer it with `axi respond`.
Backgrounding a call is fine for an agent harness, but the run never advances past a gate on its own.
When the CI step is still monitoring an open PR and checks are green - or the trusted default-branch config declares [`no_ci: true`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#no_ci) with no registered checks - `axi run` exits successfully with `outcome: checks-passed` instead of waiting for a human merge. A generic empty check list without that declaration is not ready.
Treat that as the agent stopping point: ask the user to review and merge the PR from the `help` line.
If that PR later falls behind the default branch or hits a merge conflict, do not run `axi run`, `rerun`, or a manual rebase while the CI monitor is still running.
The monitor auto-rebases onto the base, resolves actual conflicts, restarts validation at Review, and re-pushes the branch through Push; a PR that is merely behind but clean needs no command.
Use `no-mistakes rerun` only after that monitor is no longer running, such as a closed PR, aborted or superseded run, idle timeout, or exhausted CI auto-fix attempts.
Successful outcomes (`checks-passed` and `passed`) also carry `help` instructions telling the agent to summarize the run.
When the pipeline applied fixes, they include a `fixes` table and a `help` instruction to acknowledge the misses and list those fixes for the user's review.

## no-mistakes axi respond

Answer the current approval gate and continue until the next gate, CI-ready decision point, or final outcome.

```sh
no-mistakes axi respond --action approve
no-mistakes axi respond --action fix --findings F1,F2 --instructions "optional guidance"
no-mistakes axi respond --action fix --add-finding '{"description":"...","action":"auto-fix"}'
no-mistakes axi respond --action skip
```

| Flag             | Type     | Default       | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--action`       | `string` | (none)        | `approve`, `fix`, or `skip`; required                                |
| `--step`         | `string` | awaiting step | Step to respond to                                                   |
| `--findings`     | `string` | (none)        | Comma-separated finding IDs for `--action fix`                       |
| `--instructions` | `string` | (none)        | Guidance applied to selected findings                                |
| `--add-finding`  | `string` | (none)        | JSON finding object to add and fix                                   |
| `-y`, `--yes`    | `bool`   | `false`       | Auto-resolve every subsequent gate until a decision point or outcome |

After the explicit response, `--yes` uses the same auto-resolution behavior as `axi run --yes`: have the pipeline fix `auto-fix` and `ask-user` findings once, approve the fix review, approve gates that only contain non-actionable `no-op` findings, and stop at `outcome: checks-passed` when the CI monitor reports readiness but the PR still needs a human merge.
Each `axi respond` blocks until the next gate, CI-ready decision point, or final outcome.
If it returns another `gate:`, answer that gate; do not idle-wait for the run to move forward by itself.
When the daemon is already running, `axi respond` can continue an active run even if the global config file has become invalid, because it is not starting a fresh run.
The same successful-output reporting instructions apply to `axi respond` results.

## no-mistakes axi status

When `--run` is omitted, show this branch's run: its active run, else its most recent one.
Resolution is scoped to the current branch and never falls back to another branch's run, because one clone commonly has several worktrees on different branches.
On a successful status response, when the current branch has no run of its own - including a detached `HEAD`, which owns no branch and so reports `current_branch: unknown` - the output carries no run object at all.
It reports `current_branch`, `runs_on_current_branch: 0` where a branch is known, and the recent-runs listing, so an unrelated run can never be read as this worktree's.
If the implicit current-branch lookup itself fails, status returns that error instead of presenting the failure as a detached or no-run result.
Detached-`HEAD` help offers deliberate `--run <id>` inspection or checking out a branch; it does not offer `axi run`, which requires a branch.
With `--run <id>`, inspect exactly that run regardless of branch; when its branch differs from a known current branch, it is rendered under `other_branch_run:` instead of `run:`, alongside a top-level `current_branch`, so a parser keyed on `run:` never picks up a run proven to be on another branch.
An explicit `--run <id>` rendered under `run:` while the current branch is unknown (detached `HEAD` or a branch-lookup failure) encodes no branch relationship.

```sh
no-mistakes axi status
no-mistakes axi status --run <id>
```

| Flag    | Type     | Default            | Description               |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `--run` | `string` | current-branch run | Inspect a specific run ID |

When the resolved run is parked at an `awaiting_approval` or `fix_review` gate, its top-level `run:` or `other_branch_run:` object includes `awaiting_agent: parked <duration>` immediately after `status`.
The field disappears after that run's gate is answered, on cancel, and on terminal outcomes; use it to distinguish a run waiting for the driving agent from one actively running, fixing, or watching CI.
Status offers branch-scoped `axi respond` commands only for the current branch's implicitly resolved run. An explicitly selected gate stays inspection-only even when its branch matches, because a newer active run on that branch could receive the bare response command instead; the gate remains visible and its log commands retain `--run <id>`.
When the resolved run has a `running` or `fixing` step, the run object includes `active_steps`.
Each row reports how long the step has been active, the latest meaningful log or native-agent lifecycle activity, the native agent PID if one is currently running, and the current round such as `round 1`, `auto-fix 1/3`, or `fix 2`.
If no activity arrives for longer than `step_quiet_warning`, `last_activity` is prefixed with `quiet`; this is only a liveness signal and does not cancel the step.
For older active runs with no recorded activity timestamp, AXI falls back to the step log file modification time.
Gate summaries and finding descriptions are bounded in this default status view; truncated values disclose their original length, and the gate help points to `no-mistakes axi logs --step <step> --full` for an implicitly resolved run or `no-mistakes axi logs --run <id> --step <step> --full` for an explicitly selected run.
Relevant current-branch states also include a cached `branch_sync` object with full SHAs, the run's status, the persisted pipeline push binding, target kind and ref, relation, safety result, PR lifecycle, and a structured next action.
Cached home and status rendering performs no network read and labels the remote observation `pipeline_push`; only explicit sync check or apply reports `live` freshness.

## no-mistakes axi sync

Freshly check or apply the guarded synchronization offered by a `branch_sync.next_action`.

```sh
no-mistakes axi sync --check
no-mistakes axi sync
no-mistakes axi sync --recover
no-mistakes axi sync --recover --keep-local
```

| Flag           | Type   | Default | Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--check`      | `bool` | `false` | Verify the live target and exact plan without changing `HEAD`                |
| `--recover`    | `bool` | `false` | Return custody of a branch stranded by a terminal run with unpublished pipeline commits (a no-op when cancellation already released the branch) |
| `--keep-local` | `bool` | `false` | With `--recover`: keep the current local head; never touches the worktree   |

The default command is an explicit non-interactive apply request and never prompts.
All modes return the complete `branch_sync` object as TOON.
Exit code `0` means an eligible check, applied synchronization or recovery, already-synchronized, custody-returned, or user-owned no-op, or expected merged-and-removed no-op; blocked operational states return `1`.
The ordinary worktree mutation is either a strict fast-forward of the invoking clean checked-out branch to the freshly verified pipeline-owned pushed SHA, or an equivalent-diverged advance.
When a clean local branch and the pipeline-pushed head are diverged but the local unique work is content-equivalent to work already represented in the live pipeline head, `sync` reports `safety: safe_equivalent_advance`, anchors the pre-sync head under `refs/no-mistakes/sync-anchor/<run>`, and moves to the pipeline head with reset semantics.
Genuine divergence still reports `safety: blocked_diverged` and changes nothing.
Under `--recover`, the possible worktree mutation is a strict fast-forward to the preserved pipeline head, or an adoption of a preserved head proven to carry every local change, both after relation-specific preservation checks.
When the local gate branch is exactly at a newer same-branch pushed binding and Git proves that an older terminal run's unpublished preserved head is its ancestor, branch synchronization selects the newer binding; missing gate evidence, non-ancestor heads, or different or ambiguous target provenance remain blocked.
Fork configurations verify the configured fork URL and exact feature ref rather than assuming `origin`.
Dirty, in-progress, ahead, genuinely diverged, detached, wrong-branch, offline, changed-target, rewritten, deleted, legacy, or retired states fail closed without destructive recovery.
Run `axi sync` only when structured output offers `next_action.code: sync`; process any blocked state instead of substituting reset, stash, merge, rebase, force, or branch replacement.

### Custody recovery

A run that goes terminal (cancelled, failed, or completed without a push stage) after moving the pipeline head leaves the branch `pipeline_owned`. Status offers `next_action.code: recover_custody` only when recovery can establish the same eligibility it will enforce: an equal or ahead local head proves the source locally and can create the local anchor when the gate is unavailable, but any existing gate recovery ref must still match the recorded head; importing a missing preserved head requires an exact run-specific gate anchor (or legacy commit evidence that can be anchored), a clean worktree, and either local ancestry or the content-preservation proof described below. The eligible state reports `safety: blocked_pipeline_owned_recoverable`, the run's terminal `pipeline.status`, and the exact `submitted_head`/`current_head`/`relation` ownership facts.
A run whose terminalization verifies that the managed worktree head never changed from the submitted head releases the branch instead: the terminal outcome, including cancellation, ends ownership; status reports `state: user_owned` with the same exact ownership facts and no `next_action`; the branch and head are immediately usable for any separately authorized delivery; and nothing blocks a direct push or PR.
Without positive evidence that the submitted head stayed unchanged, custody is not guessed away. Missing or conflicting evidence, and import cases with a dirty worktree or genuinely divergent history, require manual reconciliation instead of advertising a recovery that will refuse.
While a run is still active, it reports `state: pipeline_owned`, the exact submitted/current heads and their relation, and `next_action.code: continue_active_run` with `no-mistakes axi status`, even when its head has not moved yet.
`--recover` verifies the run is terminal, anchors the preserved head under `refs/no-mistakes/recover/<run>` in the invoking repository, and stamps custody returned so a fresh run can start.
For equal or ahead worktrees where the preserved head is already locally reachable, recovery writes that anchor locally without requiring gate access. If the gate is available, an existing symbolic, non-commit, or mismatched recovery ref is conflicting evidence and recovery refuses without overwriting it.
For behind or diverged worktrees, recovery verifies the preserved head at the run-specific recovery ref in the local gate and fetches it into the anchor before moving or refusing. Legacy recorded heads that remain available as unreferenced gate objects are anchored before recovery continues.
A clean behind worktree fast-forwards.
A diverged worktree is adopted only when the preserved head provably carries every local change, proven by an executable three-way merge whose result is exactly the preserved head's tree.
This covers a pipeline rebase onto a newer base without requiring the gate branch to advance to the preserved head.
Terminalization pins a verified unpublished pipeline head under a run-specific recovery ref, so recovery does not require the gate branch itself to have advanced. If the recorded head is genuinely missing, status reports manual reconciliation instead of advertising `recover_custody`.
That adoption anchors the pre-recovery local head under `refs/no-mistakes/recover-local/<run>`, then moves the branch with Git operations that refuse on their own rather than after a preceding check: an atomic compare-and-swap on the branch ref, and a working-tree update that aborts instead of overwriting a modified or untracked file.
The proof is deliberately narrow and never uses patch identity, which discards hunk locations and whitespace and so cannot tell a genuine replay from a same-shaped edit elsewhere.
Anything it cannot decide - unlanded local commits, or a rebase whose fix rounds also rewrote your own lines - still refuses with the anchor named, because only escalation can tell a deliberate pipeline fix apart from a dropped change.
A dirty worktree refuses with explicit choices.
When you explicitly keep a behind or diverged local head instead of taking the preserved head, `--keep-local` returns custody at the current head without touching the worktree and atomically points the gate branch at it. If the gate branch moved independently, recovery first preserves that head under `refs/no-mistakes/recover-gate/<run>`; a conflicting pre-existing anchor makes recovery refuse, and a concurrent gate push wins the compare-and-swap and also makes recovery refuse.
`no-mistakes rerun` is the alternative exit that resumes validating the preserved head instead of taking the branch back.
A recovered never-pushed run reports `state: custody_returned`; a recovered pushed run reports its ordinary classification against the last push binding, typically `local_ahead`.
On a `user_owned` branch, `--recover` is an idempotent no-op success: nothing pipeline-created exists to recover, and no file, ref, or database row changes.

## no-mistakes axi logs

Show the log output of one pipeline step.

```sh
no-mistakes axi logs --step review
no-mistakes axi logs --step review --full
no-mistakes axi logs --step review --run <id>
```

| Flag     | Type     | Default            | Description                             |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `--step` | `string` | (none)             | Step name; required                     |
| `--run`  | `string` | current-branch run | Run ID to inspect                       |
| `--full` | `bool`   | `false`            | Show the entire log instead of the tail |

When `--run` is omitted, the run is resolved the same way as [`axi status`](#no-mistakes-axi-status): this branch's run, never another branch's.
With `--run <id>`, logs are read from exactly that run regardless of branch.
An unknown explicit run ID exits nonzero with `error: run "<id>" not found` instead of reporting that the current branch has no run.
Without `--full`, long logs show the last 40 lines and a help hint for the full log; when `--run <id>` selected the log, that hint retains the same run ID.
Step logs include native subprocess agent lifecycle lines such as `codex started pid=4242`, `codex exited pid=4242 status=success`, and transient retry messages when the selected agent supports lifecycle events.
They also include fix-loop markers such as `auto-fix round 1/3 starting after round 1` and `user-fix round starting after round 2`.

## no-mistakes axi abort

Cancel the active run for the current branch.
Active runs on other branches are left alone.

```sh
no-mistakes axi abort
```

If there is no active run, this succeeds as a no-op.

Pass `--run <id>` to cancel a specific run by its id instead of resolving the current branch:

```sh
no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>
```

`--run` does not need a repo, branch, or worktree, so it works from anywhere.
Use it to reap an orphaned CI monitor whose worktree was torn down before the PR merged - the run id is shown in `axi run` output and in the `axi` home view.
A `--run` id that is not currently active is resolved against the exact run's durable record rather than trusted blindly: a known already-terminal run returns an idempotent success carrying its terminal `run_status` with no fabricated new cancellation, a positively proven unknown id keeps the documented successful no-op with no fabricated state, and a run that is recorded as still nonterminal or cannot be read returns the nonzero terminal-unconfirmed contract.
When the daemon is not running, nothing can be cancelled and abort never starts one: the durable record alone decides the same three outcomes, and a recorded nonterminal run reports that cancellation could not be requested.
When the daemon is already running, `axi abort` can cancel an active run even if the global config file has become invalid, because it is not starting a fresh run.
Both abort surfaces report a completed cancellation only after the exact run positively confirms a terminal state within the bounded wait; success then includes the terminal `run_status`, and branch-scoped abort renders the refreshed `branch_sync` object and its exact next action, if any.
When terminal quiescence cannot be confirmed - the bounded wait expires, the wait is cancelled, or a status read fails - abort exits nonzero, states explicitly that cancellation was requested but terminal quiescence is unconfirmed, includes the last structured run state when one is available, and never claims `aborted: true` or presents user-owned or recoverable ownership guidance as authoritative; re-run the abort or watch `axi status --run <id>` until a terminal status is confirmed.
Pipeline-created commits remain preserved in the gate and a recoverable cancellation points directly to `no-mistakes axi sync --recover`; when the submitted head never moved, cancellation instead reports `state: user_owned` with no sync action.
While a run is active, do not use `axi abort` or `no-mistakes rerun` to go fix a finding yourself.
That cancels the pipeline's in-flight work and forces a full re-validation; use `axi respond --action fix` at the gate so the pipeline applies and re-checks the fix.

## no-mistakes eject

Remove the gate from the current repository.

```sh
no-mistakes eject
```

Removes the `no-mistakes` remote, deletes the bare repo directory, cleans up worktrees, and deletes the database record (cascades to runs and steps).
It does not remove any legacy repo-local agent skill files left by older versions; current `init` installs the skill at user level instead.

## no-mistakes attach

Attach to the active pipeline run.

```sh
no-mistakes attach [--run <id>]
```

| Flag    | Type     | Default | Description                                           |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--run` | `string` | (none)  | Attach to a specific run ID instead of the active run |

Opens the TUI for the active run anywhere in the current repo. If `--run` is specified, attaches to that specific run regardless of branch. Unlike bare `no-mistakes`, this does not stay branch-scoped before falling back.

## no-mistakes rerun

Rerun the pipeline for the current branch.

```sh
no-mistakes rerun
no-mistakes rerun --intent "the revised user goal"
```

Starts a new pipeline run from the current gate branch, except when the latest
terminal run has a verified unpublished head whose custody has not been
returned: rerun then uses that preserved terminal head even if the gate branch
is stale. The command refuses instead of falling back to the gate branch when
the run-specific recovery ref is conflicting, invalid, or the recorded head is
unavailable. Use `no-mistakes axi status` and reconcile custody first in that
case.
If the selected prior run has explicit intent, rerun inherits it exactly by default;
otherwise it performs fresh intent inference. `--intent` supplies a new canonical
explicit intent in either case. Inherited intent keeps distinct rerun provenance;
an override is recorded as newly supplied explicit intent, while fresh inference
records the transcript source. If another run is active on that branch, rerun
cancels it before starting over. Treat rerun as a between-runs action after a
failed or cancelled outcome, or after you have committed a separate fix outside
an active run; do not use it to bypass a gate.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--intent` | `string` | (none) | Explicit intent overriding inherited intent or fresh inference |

## no-mistakes sync

Freshly verify and, with confirmation, safely move the invoking branch to an exact pipeline-owned push binding.

```sh
no-mistakes sync
no-mistakes sync --check
no-mistakes sync --yes
no-mistakes sync --recover
no-mistakes sync --recover --keep-local
```

| Flag           | Type   | Default | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--check`      | `bool` | `false` | Verify and print the fresh plan without changing `HEAD`         |
| `-y`, `--yes`  | `bool` | `false` | Apply an eligible guarded synchronization without an interactive prompt |
| `--recover`    | `bool` | `false` | Return custody of a branch stranded by a terminal run with unpublished pipeline commits (a no-op when cancellation already released the branch) |
| `--keep-local` | `bool` | `false` | With `--recover`: keep the current local head; never touches the worktree |

Without `--yes`, apply prints the exact full-SHA plan and requires TTY confirmation; `--recover` prompts the same way before returning custody.
A non-TTY apply or recovery refuses with a direct `--yes` hint.
The command uses the same service and safety contract as `no-mistakes axi sync`, including the guarded equivalent advance and custody recovery documented there; it never stashes, rebases, creates a merge commit, switches branches, deletes a branch, or updates an external remote.

## no-mistakes status

Show repo, daemon, active run, and relevant cached local-branch synchronization status.

```sh
no-mistakes status
```

Displays:

- Repo path, upstream URL, and fork URL when configured
- Gate path
- Daemon status (running/stopped, PID)
- Active run details: ID, branch, status, head SHA, start time

## no-mistakes runs

List recorded pipeline runs for the current repo.

```sh
no-mistakes runs [--limit <n>]
```

| Flag      | Type  | Default | Description                       |
| --------- | ----- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--limit` | `int` | `10`    | Maximum number of runs to display |

Shows runs newest-first with branch, status (styled), short SHA, timestamp, and PR URL if set.

## no-mistakes eval

Inspect the locally collected review-case corpus before spending tokens, replay an explicit agent and model in isolation, and report finding-level scores, token cost, wall time, and the recall-versus-cost frontier. Eligible cases are collected automatically as runs finish; `eval capture <run-id>` collects one on demand; `eval miss ingest <run-id> --finding '<json>'` labels a confirmed post-PR miss (review passed green, later caught) as false-negative gold.

See [Evaluation toolkit](/no-mistakes/reference/eval/) for the local-only boundary, collection and retention, command flags, label policy, and reporting semantics.

## no-mistakes stats

Show historical usage stats across all repos.

```sh
no-mistakes stats
```

Displays total changes, rescued changes, rescue rate, reported and fixed mistakes, fixes by pipeline step, and the top repos by rescue activity.

Use `--agents` for local, per-purpose agent performance aggregates: duration and the subprocess-vs-model time split, session mode, errors, the token totals (input, output, cache-read, cache-creation, fresh input, reasoning), and the model round-trip and tool-category activity histogram, with a `METRICS` coverage count that tells a real zero apart from missing instrumentation.
Use `--run <id>` to inspect the individual agent invocations for one run - including each invocation's per-round token deltas next to the raw counters (cumulative across a resumed session for codex; per-invocation for pi), tool-category breakdown, workload size, finding count, and fallback reason - plus the total time parked at approval gates; it implies `--agents`.
Nullable fields an adapter did not report render as `-` (unknown), which is distinct from a recorded `0`; the legacy raw input, output, and cache-read counters remain numeric.

```sh
no-mistakes stats --agents
no-mistakes stats --run <id>
```

This detailed performance evidence stays local in `state.sqlite`; it is not sent to telemetry.
The field definitions and their local/remote split are owned by [the environment reference](/reference/environment/#what-stays-local-and-what-leaves-the-machine).

## no-mistakes doctor

Check system health and dependencies.

```sh
no-mistakes doctor
```

Checks:

- `git` binary
- `gh` CLI (optional, needed for GitHub PR and CI steps)
- `az` CLI (optional, needed for Azure DevOps PR and CI steps)
- Data directory (`~/.no-mistakes/`)
- SQLite database
- Daemon status
- Agent runners: native binaries `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `acli`, `opencode`, `pi`, `copilot`, and `agy` (Antigravity), plus the optional ACP bridge `acpx`
- ACP alias default binaries: `cursor-agent` plus `acpx` for `cursor`
- Effective global agent configuration, reported as `gate validation`; an unavailable configured runner is a failed check because the gate cannot validate without it
- Every configured [`forge_profiles`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#forge_profiles) entry, reported as `forge <host>`: the profile resolves and validates, its provider CLI is installed, and that CLI is authenticated for the profile's host

Uses indicators: `✓` (available), `–` (not found, optional), `✗` (problem detected).

The standalone runner rows inspect default binary names; the `cursor` row reports whichever of `cursor-agent` and `acpx` are missing.
The [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/) owns ACP gate-validation availability and probing semantics.
Each validation run performs the authoritative agent resolution again after applying any trusted repository-level override.

`doctor` checks `gh` and `az` availability. [Provider Integration](/no-mistakes/guides/provider-integration/) owns the separate setup checks for GitLab, Forgejo, Bitbucket Cloud, Gitea, and the Azure DevOps extension and PAT.

`tea` stays docs-only like `glab`, `forgejo-axi`, and Bitbucket's env vars, rather than an active `doctor` check like `gh`/`az`: Gitea is almost always self-hosted, so a bare "`tea` not found" row would be a near-universal, low-value warning for the vast majority of users who have no Gitea instance at all.

## no-mistakes update

Update the installed binary and reset the daemon.

```sh
no-mistakes update
no-mistakes update --beta
no-mistakes update -y
no-mistakes update --force
```

Downloads the latest release, verifies the SHA-256 checksum, atomically replaces the running binary, and resets the daemon when it is running or stale daemon artifacts exist so the new executable is picked up, preferring the managed service path and falling back to a detached daemon if service startup is unavailable or fails.
By default this installs the latest stable release.
Pass `--beta` to include prereleases and install the latest beta when one is newer than the current stable release.
If the daemon is running from a different executable path, update still prompts before replacing it; pass `-y`/`--yes` to answer that prompt non-interactively.
If the daemon executable path cannot be determined, the update aborts before replacement.
If the daemon does not come back cleanly after a successful replacement, the command reports that failure.
On macOS, removes the quarantine extended attribute.
[Daemon & Worktrees](/no-mistakes/concepts/daemon/#starting-and-stopping)
owns the active-run guard, the scope of `--force` and `--yes`, and recursive
validation-step containment.

Because `update` installs the latest official release binary, the replacement binary includes the default self-hosted telemetry host and website ID. Disable telemetry with `NO_MISTAKES_TELEMETRY=0`, or override the host and website ID with `NO_MISTAKES_UMAMI_HOST` and `NO_MISTAKES_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`.

Background update checks run automatically on each CLI invocation (except `update` itself and version queries `--version` / `-v`, which stay side-effect-free). If a newer version is available, a notification is printed to stderr. Suppressed for dev builds or when `NO_MISTAKES_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` is set.

## no-mistakes daemon start

Start the daemon, installing or refreshing the managed service when possible.

```sh
no-mistakes daemon start
```

Prefers the managed service path and falls back to a detached daemon if service install or startup is unavailable or fails. If the daemon is already running, the command refreshes a stale macOS `launchd` or Linux `systemd` service definition and restarts through the managed service; if the definition is unchanged, it reports that the daemon is already running. [Daemon & Worktrees](/no-mistakes/concepts/daemon/#starting-and-stopping) owns the startup readiness, timeout, fallback cleanup, and singleton lifecycle details.

## no-mistakes daemon stop

Stop the running daemon process.

```sh
no-mistakes daemon stop
no-mistakes daemon stop --force
```

[Daemon & Worktrees](/no-mistakes/concepts/daemon/#starting-and-stopping)
owns the active-run guard, the scope of `--force`, and recursive
validation-step containment.

This does not remove the managed service. A later `no-mistakes`, `no-mistakes daemon start`, `init`, `attach`, `rerun`, or `update` can start the daemon again through the same service manager when available, or as a detached daemon otherwise.

## no-mistakes daemon restart

Restart the daemon.

```sh
no-mistakes daemon restart
no-mistakes daemon restart --force
```

Stops the current daemon and starts it again. This works whether the daemon is currently running or not.
[Daemon & Worktrees](/no-mistakes/concepts/daemon/#starting-and-stopping)
owns the active-run guard, the scope of `--force`, and recursive
validation-step containment.

## no-mistakes daemon status

Check whether the daemon is running.

```sh
no-mistakes daemon status
```

Shows the PID if the daemon is running.
