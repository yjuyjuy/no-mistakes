title: Configuration
description: Global and per-repo configuration options.
---

Configuration is optional. Without any config files, `no-mistakes` defaults to
`agent: auto`, which picks the first supported native agent or ACP alias available on your system,
with sensible defaults for everything else.

The goal is not to make you configure a mini CI system. The default path should
work. Config exists for the parts that genuinely vary by machine or repo:

- which agent or ordered fallback list you prefer
- which test or lint commands are the canonical ones for this repo
- which extra review rules apply to which paths
- where test evidence artifacts should be stored
- how aggressive the auto-fix loop should be
- which subject template pipeline-generated fix commits should use
- how soon AXI should call an active step quiet
- whether the review loop reuses supported native agent sessions
- whether no-mistakes should infer intent from recent local agent transcripts

Config is split across two files:

| File                         | Scope                         | Full field reference                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml` | Global defaults for all repos | [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/) |
| `<repo>/.no-mistakes.yaml`   | Per-repo overrides            | [Repo Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/)     |

Set `NM_HOME` to relocate the global config directory (the global file becomes `$NM_HOME/config.yaml`).
Bitbucket Cloud credentials come from environment variables rather than config files.
For Azure DevOps, authenticate the `az` CLI with either `az devops login` or `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` for non-interactive daemon auth; see [Environment Variables](/no-mistakes/reference/environment/).

## How to think about config

- **Global config** is for your machine-level defaults.
- **Repo config** is for codebase-specific behavior that should travel with the repo.

In practice, most teams should keep personal preferences global and repo policy
local.

## What to configure first

If you are not sure where to start, configure these in this order:

1. Set `commands.lint` (and a **targeted** `commands.test` only when you want a deterministic local baseline - not a full CI suite) so the gate runs the exact local checks your repo expects.
2. Override `agent` per repo only when one codebase clearly works better with a different tool or fallback order.
3. Tune `auto_fix` after you have seen how much automation you actually want.

Everything else can usually wait.

The reference pages own each field's syntax, defaults, and exact semantics.
The rest of this page covers only the cross-cutting rules that involve both files at once.

## Precedence

- Repo config overrides global config field by field: repo `agent` replaces the global `agent` (including a full ordered fallback list), while `auto_fix`, `ci`, `commit`, `intent`, and the repository-scoped `test.evidence` fields overlay individual fields and fall through to the global default for anything unset (`intent.disabled_readers` adds to the globally disabled readers instead of replacing them). Local evidence location and retention are machine-wide and remain global-only; the [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#testevidence) owns the exact boundary.
- `agent_path_override`, `agent_config`, `agent_args_override`, `agent_args_override_per_step`, `acpx_path`, `acp_registry_overrides`, `ci_timeout`, `daemon_connect_timeout`, `branch_sync_remote_timeout`, `step_quiet_warning`, `agent_timeout`, `review_agent_timeout`, `test_agent_timeout`, `log_level`, and `session_reuse` are global-only fields.
- `commands`, `ignore_patterns`, `document.instructions`, `review.path_instructions`, `allow_repo_commands`, and `disable_project_settings` are repo-only fields. By default, `commands` and `agent` are read from the trusted default branch; a trusted `allow_repo_commands: true` opt-in instead honors their pushed-branch values. The other gate-control fields, including `review.path_instructions` and the repo `ci` overlay, always come from the trusted default branch. See the [Repo Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/) security note.
- no-mistakes reloads global config while setting up each run, so edits made before starting a run apply to it. To vary the profile between steps of one run (for example a deep review and a cheap document pass), use [`agent_args_override_per_step`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_args_override_per_step); for whole separate profiles, use separately initialized `NM_HOME` roots, which move all no-mistakes state, not just config. For ready-made small/medium/large profiles built on both levers, see [Size Profiles](/no-mistakes/guides/size-profiles/).

## House rules for part of the tree

Most review guidance belongs in the repository's own agent instructions, which every gate agent already reads. Use `review.path_instructions` for the rules that apply to only part of the tree: each entry pairs a path glob with guidance, and the review step appends only the entries whose glob matches a file the change actually touched, each labelled with the path and files it was selected for. A branch that matches nothing, or a repo with nothing configured, gets the review prompt it would get without the setting.

These blocks steer a gate agent, so they are read from your default branch rather than from the branch being reviewed, and `allow_repo_commands` does not change that. Commit them to the default branch before expecting a run to honor them. The [Repo Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#reviewpath_instructions) owns the syntax, the glob rules, the size limits, and the exact trust semantics.

## Explicit commands versus agent detection

Explicit `commands.test` and `commands.lint` give you deterministic local baseline behavior, while leaving either empty asks the configured agent to fill the gap: empty `commands.test` has the agent select the smallest relevant tests under the targeted-validation contract (broad regression stays in remote CI), and empty `commands.lint` folds lint into the document step's combined housekeeping pass.
An empty `commands.format` runs no separate formatter, so configure it explicitly when the push step must format agent changes.
Either way, available user intent can trigger an evidence-oriented agent follow-up after a successful test baseline. Evidence stays in no-mistakes-managed local storage unless a supported provider publishes it to an orphan evidence branch through `test.evidence.store_in_repo`; the [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#testevidence) owns its location, cleanup, provider support, and fail-closed behavior.
The [Repo Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/) owns the exact per-command semantics (including that `commands.test` is targeted, not CI-parity), command process lifetime, and the `ignore_patterns` match rules.

Before a new validation gate starts, its effective agent configuration must resolve to a runnable native agent or ACP runner; otherwise the gate fails before its first pipeline step, even when explicit commands are configured.
Run `no-mistakes doctor` to check the global runner, and see [Choosing an Agent](/no-mistakes/guides/agents/) for how agent selection and fallback lists behave.
