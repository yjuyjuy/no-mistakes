title: Choosing an Agent
description: Supported AI agents, how to pick one, and how they integrate.
---

`no-mistakes` is pipeline-agent-agnostic by design: the gate should mean the same thing regardless of which supported agent backend you prefer.
It is not runner-free.
Every validation run requires a supported native agent binary, the `agent: cursor` ACP alias, or an explicit `acp:<target>` through `acpx`.
The default `agent: auto` setting picks the first supported native agent or ACP alias available on your system.

The coding agent that calls `no-mistakes axi` drives approval gates, but it does not automatically become the pipeline agent that performs review, evidence testing, documentation, combined documentation-and-lint housekeeping, or fixes.
Those jobs run in the daemon's disposable worktree through the configured pipeline agent.
A validation-step agent inspects, fixes, and returns only its assigned phase; delivery requirements in user intent remain acceptance context, but the outer executor alone performs the other validation, push, PR, and CI phases.
If that step attempts pipeline control, no-mistakes returns `error.code: nested_gate_context`; the agent must return control to the outer executor, while read-only `no-mistakes axi status`, `no-mistakes axi logs`, help, and `no-mistakes doctor` remain available.

The agent is responsible for the parts of the gate that benefit from judgment:
code review, evidence-oriented test validation, test or lint detection when you
have not configured explicit commands, auto-fixing, and setup-wizard suggestions
when you leave prompts blank.

Pipeline agent prompts also include a workspace-boundary preamble and an execution-context section with the exact worktree directory and path contract.
It tells agents to keep intentional source, project, user-data, and system file writes inside the disposable worktree, use that exact path prefix when tools require absolute paths without guessing or re-resolving paths, avoid mutating system state such as Homebrew packages, `/Applications`, or global tool config, and treat that boundary as prompt steering rather than true enforcement.
The only intentional out-of-worktree write it allows is test evidence under the run's managed evidence directory when a testing prompt asks for it.
Incidental temp or cache writes from normal development tools are still allowed.
Testing prompts also ask agents to remove transient working-tree artifacts they created, such as downloaded models, caches, build outputs, large binaries, or generated data directories, before reporting completion.

## How to choose quickly

- Leave `agent: auto` if one good agent is already installed and you do not need repo-specific behavior.
- Set a repo-level `agent` override when one codebase clearly works better with a different tool.
- Use an ordered fallback list when you prefer one agent but want no-mistakes to try another if the first process is unavailable.
- Set explicit `commands.lint` and a **targeted** `commands.test` if you want deterministic local baseline command execution regardless of agent choice; leave `commands.test` empty for agent-selected smallest relevant checks. Do not configure a complete-suite walk as local Test - remote CI owns broad regression.

That last point matters: the agent helps fill in gaps, but explicit repo
commands are still the strongest way to make the baseline gate predictable.
When user intent is available, the test step may still invoke the configured agent after `commands.test` succeeds to gather evidence that demonstrates the change.
That testing invocation is expected to leave only intentional source or test-file changes in the worktree, while preserving requested evidence files under the dedicated evidence directory.
That directory is always outside the worktree and is reaped by no-mistakes on a bounded retention schedule; GitHub repos can opt into publishing it to an orphan evidence branch with `test.evidence.store_in_repo`. See [`test.evidence`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#testevidence) for its location and cleanup.

## Runner requirements

A complete gate never degrades silently when its configured pipeline agent is unavailable.
The daemon resolves the effective agent before creating pipeline step records, and the run fails immediately with setup guidance if the configured binary cannot run.
This refusal also applies when deterministic test or lint commands are configured because review and documentation always require agent judgment, while rebase, PR, and CI paths may need an agent to resolve conflicts, generate content, or fix failures.

| Surface or capability | Works without a runnable pipeline agent? | Behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Install, `init`, daemon lifecycle, `status`, `runs`, and `doctor` | Yes | Local setup and diagnostics remain available. `doctor` reports that gate validation is unavailable. |
| Start or rerun a validation gate | No | The run fails before any pipeline step starts. |
| Review | No | Requires agent judgment and structured findings. |
| Test with `commands.test` | No, as part of a full gate | The command is deterministic, but the gate refuses before steps start rather than presenting command-only validation as a complete pass. |
| Test without `commands.test`, or evidence validation with user intent | No | Requires the agent to discover checks and gather end-to-end evidence. |
| Document | No | Requires the agent to discover and update documentation gaps. |
| Lint with `commands.lint` | No, as part of a full gate | The command is deterministic, but the full gate still requires an agent. |
| Lint without `commands.lint` and all fix rounds | No | The document step performs the initial combined housekeeping pass, and an agent is still needed for fallback assessment or code changes. |
| Push, PR, and CI as part of a gate | No | They run only after the required validation steps, and PR or CI paths may invoke the agent themselves. |

### Antigravity and Gemini setups

Running the gate from Antigravity or another Gemini-based coding environment does not make that calling model available to the daemon automatically.
Choose one of these supported setups:

1. Install any supported native agent CLI and leave `agent: auto`, or select it explicitly in `~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml`.
2. Install both `cursor-agent` and `acpx`, then leave `agent: auto` or select `agent: cursor`.
3. Install `acpx`, confirm that the Gemini ACP target works locally, and configure `agent: acp:gemini`.

```yaml
# ~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml
agent: acp:gemini

# Optional when acpx is not on PATH.
acpx_path: C:\path\to\acpx.exe
```

Run `no-mistakes doctor` afterward and look for a successful `gate validation` line.
Doctor checks the global agent configuration; each run performs the authoritative check again after applying any trusted repository-level agent override.
If the calling environment exposes neither a supported native CLI nor a working ACP target, it can still inspect and respond to existing AXI state, but it cannot start an honest validation gate by itself.

## Setting the agent

### Global default

```yaml
# ~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml
agent: auto
```

### Per-repo override

```yaml
# .no-mistakes.yaml
agent: codex
```

Repo config takes precedence over global config.

### Ordered fallback list

```yaml
# ~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml or .no-mistakes.yaml
agent: [codex, grok]
```

### Optional ACP target

If you install `acpx` separately, you can opt into any ACP target with the `acp:` prefix, for example `agent: acp:gemini`.
`agent: auto` probes native agents and first-class ACP aliases (such as `cursor`), and never auto-selects arbitrary `acp:<target>` entries.

The [`agent` field reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent) owns the exact resolution order, fallback-list filtering and retry semantics, and the failure behavior when no entry is runnable.

## Where agent choice matters most

Changing agents most directly affects:

- review quality and tone
- test evidence collection, plus test and lint detection when commands are not configured
- how good auto-fix attempts are for your stack
- branch name and commit subject suggestions in the setup wizard

It does **not** change the pipeline order or the meaning of a passed gate.

## Driving no-mistakes as an agent

The primary way to put a change through the gate from inside a coding agent is the `/no-mistakes` skill.
A skill-aware tool like Claude Code supports two invocation modes.
Use bare `/no-mistakes` to validate existing committed work.
Use `/no-mistakes <task>` to have the agent first do the task, commit only that task's changes on a feature branch, then run the pipeline with the task text as `--intent`.
In both modes, it resolves low-risk findings on its own and stops to relay anything that needs your decision.

Grok Build is a pipeline runner, not a driving-skill target. `no-mistakes init` installs the `/no-mistakes` skill for Claude Code and agents that use the vendor-neutral `.agents` convention; the [`init` reference](/no-mistakes/reference/cli/#no-mistakes-init) owns its locations and supported consumers.
If your home directory consolidates `.claude` and `.agents` with symlinks, `init` follows the links and keeps the skill reachable from both logical paths.
Re-run `no-mistakes init` after an upgrade to refresh that skill, including overwriting stale `SKILL.md` content from an older binary.
Older versions vendored the skill into each initialized repo's `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`; those copies are no longer needed, and `init` prints a notice when it finds one so you can remove it.
The skill drives `no-mistakes axi`, a non-interactive command surface that prints TOON to stdout and progress to stderr.
When CI is ready - either its registered checks are green or the trusted default-branch config declares [`no_ci: true`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#no_ci) with no registered checks - but the PR is still open, `axi run` and `axi respond` return `outcome: checks-passed` with a help line pointing at the PR instead of waiting for a human merge. An empty check result without that declaration is not ready; see the [CI step reference](/no-mistakes/reference/pipeline-steps/#ci) for the readiness rules.
That is a successful agent stopping point: report that the PR is ready and ask the user to review and merge it.
Successful outcomes also instruct the agent to summarize the run for the user.
When the pipeline applied fixes, successful outcomes include a `fixes` table listing each fix so the agent can acknowledge what it missed and the user can review them.

If that PR later falls behind the default branch or hits a merge conflict - commonly because another PR merged first - the agent runs no command and must never hand-rebase.
The CI monitor stays live in the background after checks pass, and when it sees an actual conflict it rebases onto the base, resolves it, restarts validation at Review, and re-pushes the branch through Push, so no agent or user action is needed.
A PR that is merely behind but still clean needs nothing either, since the platform merges it.
The one exception is when that monitor is no longer running - the PR was closed, the run was aborted or superseded, it idle-timed-out, or its auto-fix attempts were exhausted - in which case the agent recovers with `no-mistakes rerun`, which cancels the stale monitor and re-runs the full pipeline including a deterministic rebase step.
The agent must not use `no-mistakes axi run` to refresh a still-active PR: after `checks-passed` it reattaches to the running monitor with HEAD unchanged and returns the monitor output without rebasing.

In task-first mode, if the repo is on the default branch, the skill tells the agent to create a feature branch before committing because the gate validates committed history on a non-default branch.
The agent should inspect `git status` before changing or committing anything, preserve unrelated pre-existing uncommitted changes, and commit only the changes that belong to the user's task.

Agents can also call `no-mistakes axi` directly:

```sh
no-mistakes axi run --intent "the user's goal"
no-mistakes axi status
no-mistakes axi sync --check
no-mistakes axi sync
no-mistakes axi sync --recover
no-mistakes axi respond --action approve
no-mistakes axi logs --step review --full
no-mistakes axi abort
no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>
```

Before any post-pipeline local commit or fresh run, read `branch_sync`.
Only when its structured `next_action.code` is `sync`, run `no-mistakes axi sync` first.
When `next_action.code` is `recover_custody` - a terminal run left unpublished pipeline commits preserved in the local gate - run `no-mistakes axi sync --recover` to return custody, or `no-mistakes rerun` to resume validating the preserved head.
A `branch_sync.state` of `user_owned` means the run went terminal before changing the submitted head and cancellation released the branch: it is immediately usable and needs no sync action.
When `next_action.code` is `continue_active_run`, run the reported command and keep driving the active run.
If synchronization is blocked, process that state instead of improvising reset, stash, merge, rebase, force, or branch replacement.
Then commit follow-up work on top so every pipeline fix commit remains in the branch.

The full driving protocol - how to read the home view and `gate:` objects, when to respond, fix, approve, or relay `ask-user` findings, and how to interpret `axi status` fields like `awaiting_agent` and `active_steps` - is owned by the skill itself and by the live `axi` output.
Each `axi` response carries version-matched `help` lines for its state, and `no-mistakes axi run --help` and `no-mistakes axi respond --help` describe the loop authoritatively for the installed binary, so agents driving a gate never need this page open.
The [CLI reference](/no-mistakes/reference/cli/) documents each `axi` command and output field for humans.

## Binary resolution

When the daemon is running through a managed service, its `PATH` comes from your login shell environment on macOS and Linux plus common user, Homebrew, and system binary directories; on Windows it reuses the current process environment.
If native agent discovery does not resolve the binary you expect, check `~/.no-mistakes/logs/daemon.log` and set an explicit override; [Environment the daemon sees](/no-mistakes/reference/environment/#environment-the-daemon-sees) owns the full resolution story.

Seven global config fields tune resolution and invocation, and the [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/) owns each one:

- [`agent_path_override`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_path_override) - custom binary paths per native agent, plus the default native binary-name table.
- [`agent_config`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config) - model and reasoning effort per agent in one common spelling, mapped down to each harness's own mechanism, with the full per-harness mapping table and the precedence rule against raw flags.
- [`agent_args_override`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_args_override) - extra CLI flags per native agent for anything `agent_config` does not cover, such as service tier or permission mode, including the reserved-flag rules and smart defaults. Keep both global-only; they reflect your local agent setup rather than repo policy.
- [`agent_args_override_per_step`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_args_override_per_step) - per-pipeline-step flag profiles that replace the global flags for one step, so an expensive step such as review can run on a strong model while housekeeping steps run on a cheap one.
- [`acpx_path`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#acpx_path) - the bridge binary path for explicit ACP targets and first-class ACP aliases.
- [`acp_registry_overrides`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#acp_registry_overrides) - raw ACP target commands, including replacements for alias defaults such as `cursor-agent acp`, plus their availability-probing rules.
- [`agent`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent) - the `auto` resolution order and ordered fallback-list semantics.

## Review session reuse

With the default `session_reuse: true`, Claude, Codex, Grok, Pi, and Antigravity keep one durable review-fixer session per run, and resume failures fall back to a fresh fixer session instead of skipping the fix turn. Pi stores its native fixer transcript in Pi's session directory; no-mistakes persists only the minimum session identity needed to resume it.
Review turns always run in fresh, session-free invocations: a rereview certifies fixes that implement the previous review turn's findings, so it must never resume the session that prescribed them.
The [`session_reuse` field reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#session_reuse) owns the exact reuse, fallback, privacy, and restart-recovery semantics.

## Agent interface

All agents implement the same interface. Each invocation receives:

- **Prompt** - the task description (review this diff, fix these findings, etc.), prefixed during pipeline runs with the workspace-boundary steering and exact execution-context contract described above
- **CWD** - the worktree directory
- **Environment** - the daemon environment plus non-interactive Git overrides (`GIT_EDITOR=true`, `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true`, and `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`) so agent-invoked Git commands do not hang on editors or credential prompts
- **JSONSchema** - optional structured output schema for typed responses
- **OnChunk** - callback for streaming text output to the TUI
- **OnLifecycle** - callback for native subprocess start, exit, and retry activity that is recorded in step logs and AXI active-step status
- **Session** - optional no-mistakes-owned native session identity for review-fixer reuse
- **Purpose** - local performance label for the pipeline duty served

Each invocation returns:

- **Output** - structured JSON output; native structured responses are returned as-is, while text-parsed fallbacks are validated before return and may use `null` for optional fields
- **Text** - raw text output
- **Usage** - token counts (input, output, cache read, cache creation)
- **SessionID** and **Resumed** - the adapter-native session identity and whether this invocation resumed it, when supported
- **Model** and **Provider** - adapter-reported serving metadata when available

When structured output comes from final text, no-mistakes validates JSON fences and concluding bare JSON objects extracted from prose against the requested schema. It accepts inline or unclosed JSON fence forms, but rejects multiple valid candidates and fails closed when fenced and bare candidates differ; semantically identical fenced and bare candidates are accepted. A bare object followed by substantive prose is not treated as a verdict.

One-shot subprocess agents (Claude, Codex, Grok, Pi, Copilot CLI, Antigravity, and acpx) are invocation-scoped.
After no-mistakes starts one, it terminates any remaining child processes when the invocation exits, fails, or is cancelled, so agent-spawned test workers, build watchers, and dev servers do not survive the step.
Step logs record their process lifecycle, including start and exit lines with the PID, and AXI status exposes that PID while the subprocess is still active.
Persistent server agents (Rovo Dev and OpenCode) use their managed server lifecycle instead.

Transient API and network failures, stochastic prose turn endings, and transient tool-call or permission validation errors are retried up to three times with exponential backoff. Provider quota and free-usage-limit errors are terminal, even when a backend marks them retryable. Retry messages are recorded as lifecycle activity for native subprocess agents, falling back to the streaming text path for direct callers that do not supply `OnLifecycle`.

## Intent extraction

When an agent starts a run through `no-mistakes axi run --intent`, no-mistakes uses that supplied intent verbatim as authoritative acceptance criteria and skips transcript-based inference, even if `intent.enabled` is false.
Review checks the diff against those criteria, and a change that removes required behavior or adds forbidden behavior becomes an `ask-user` finding instead of being resolved automatically.
Otherwise, when `intent.enabled` is true, no-mistakes reads recent local transcripts from Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Rovo Dev, Pi, and the GitHub Copilot CLI during the `intent` pipeline step.
It matches sessions against non-deleted changed files when present, falls back to all changed files for all-deletion diffs, summarizes the likely author intent with the configured pipeline agent, includes that summary as an untrusted, low-confidence hint in rebase fixes, review checks and fixes, test detection, evidence validation, and fixes, lint detection and fixes, documentation checks and fixes, CI auto-fixes, and PR prompts, and renders it in generated PR descriptions.

Transcript readers collect user and assistant text messages but exclude tool call output.
They read Claude Code transcripts from `~/.claude/projects`, Codex metadata from `~/.codex/state_*.sqlite` plus referenced rollout files, OpenCode messages from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` or `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, Rovo Dev sessions from `~/.rovodev/sessions`, Pi transcripts from `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, and GitHub Copilot CLI sessions from `~/.copilot/session-state`.
Sessions are eligible when they come from the same working directory or an equivalent Git checkout with the same common Git directory or normalized remote URL.
ACP transcripts are not currently read for intent extraction.
When deterministic matching leaves multiple plausible sessions, no-mistakes may ask the configured pipeline agent to choose among them using the matching file paths and sanitized transcript packet files. That disambiguation prompt receives the same exact execution-worktree path contract as other pipeline prompts; transcript packets remain sanitized data, not instructions.
The selected transcript text is then sent to the configured pipeline agent for summarization during the `intent` step, so intent extraction may incur additional agent or API invocations.
Before disambiguation or summarization, no-mistakes excludes tool output, redacts likely secrets, strips common prompt-control markers, and clamps long transcripts while preserving the beginning and end.
no-mistakes stores derived intent summaries and matching metadata in `~/.no-mistakes/state.sqlite`, including the source, session ID, and match score on each run plus cached summaries for matching transcript sessions.
It does not store raw transcript text in its database.
The step logs accepted candidate match diagnostics, then logs the matched source, score, and sanitized inferred intent when a transcript matches.

Use `intent.disabled_readers` to disable specific transcript sources, or set `intent.enabled: false` to opt out entirely.

## Claude

Spawns a `claude` subprocess for each invocation with `--output-format stream-json`. The print-mode user prompt is sent as text on stdin rather than placed in the process arguments. By default it also adds `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, unless you already set your own Claude permission flag through `agent_args_override`. Reads JSONL events from stdout. Supports native structured output via `--json-schema`.
For review-fixer reuse, Claude starts a stream-json session and resumes it with `claude -p --resume <id>`.

## Codex

Spawns a `codex` subprocess for each invocation with `exec --json`. When structured output is requested, no-mistakes also writes a normalized schema file and passes it with `--output-schema`. By default it also adds `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, unless you already set your own Codex approval or sandbox flag through `agent_args_override`. Reads JSONL events. Structured output is returned from the final `agent_message` text and uses the common text fallback described above when needed.
Codex model and reasoning effort belong in global [`agent_config.codex`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config), which renders them as `-m` and `-c model_reasoning_effort`. Other config overrides, such as `-c service_tier="priority"`, belong in `agent_args_override.codex`.
For review-fixer reuse, Codex resumes the reported thread with `codex exec resume <id> <prompt>`.
That resume command has a narrower flag surface than `codex exec`, so a resume that rejects an override falls back to a fresh fixer session rather than skipping the fix turn.

## Grok Build

Spawns a `grok` subprocess for each invocation using a permission-restricted prompt file and `--output-format streaming-messages-json`. Native structured output is requested with `--json-schema`; the terminal `structured_output`, session identity, model, and usage fields are read from the Messages-compatible result event. Review-loop reuse resumes the reported Grok session with `--resume`.
Without an explicit pin, Grok uses its current configured default model. See [`agent_config`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config) for model and effort configuration and native mapping.
Grok is not available to a repository with `disable_project_settings: true`, because Grok 1.0.5 still discovers native project instructions and `.grok` project surfaces; the gate fails closed before launch. See [`disable_project_settings`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#disable_project_settings) for the security boundary. System-prompt, alternate-agent, working-directory, worktree, and restore flags are reserved so global overrides cannot redirect the managed invocation.

## Antigravity

Spawns an `agy` subprocess for each invocation with `--print <prompt> --output-format stream-json`, plus `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (always present; `agent_args_override` cannot suppress it). Reads NDJSON events from stdout, streaming `step_update` text deltas to the TUI. Structured output is requested with a temporary `--json-schema` file and read from the terminal result's `structured_output`. Result precedence is terminal-authoritative: `structured_output` outranks the terminal result's `response`, which outranks the streamed deltas.
For review-fixer reuse, Antigravity resumes the reported conversation with `--conversation <id>`. A pruned or unknown conversation id starts a fresh conversation instead of failing the turn.
Usage accounting includes agy's reported `thinking_tokens` as reasoning tokens.
`--conversation`, `-c`/`--continue`, the print/output flags, and the permission flag are reserved so global overrides cannot redirect the managed invocation.

## Rovo Dev

Starts a persistent HTTP server (`acli rovodev serve`) on first use and reuses it across invocations. If a reused server refuses a connection, no-mistakes discards it and retries with a fresh server. Any `agent_args_override.rovodev` flags are inserted before no-mistakes' managed serve flags. Neither the serve command nor the REST session API takes a model or reasoning parameter, so no-mistakes cannot map those knobs for Rovo Dev; the [`agent_config`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config) reference owns the refusal and escape-hatch semantics. Communicates via REST API and SSE streaming. Each invocation creates a session, sends the prompt, streams results, then deletes the session. Structured output is handled by injecting schema instructions into a system prompt, then parsing the final text with the common fallback described above while allowing `null` for optional fields.

## OpenCode

Starts a persistent HTTP server (`opencode serve`) on first use and reuses it across invocations. If a reused server refuses a connection, no-mistakes discards it and retries with a fresh server. Any `agent_args_override.opencode` flags are inserted before no-mistakes' managed serve flags; `opencode serve` exits with usage on an unknown flag, so a model flag does not belong there. Model and reasoning effort come from [`agent_config.opencode`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config) and travel in the session message as `model` (from the `provider/model` form) and `variant`. Similar session lifecycle to Rovo Dev: create session, send message, stream SSE events until idle, delete session. Supports `json_schema` format in the message request for structured output, with `retryCount: 2` so the model gets a second chance to emit a structured response. When a provider explicitly rejects the required or forced tool choice used by that format because thinking or reasoning is enabled, no-mistakes retries once without the native format; the schema remains in the prompt, and the returned text must parse and validate against the original schema. Other provider errors do not trigger this retry, and neither does a conflict reported after the turn already invoked a tool, since that retry runs in a fresh session and would replay the tool. A turn that fails reports its cause on `info.error` with an HTTP 200, so no-mistakes fails the invocation on any `info.error` and surfaces the provider's own name, status, and message rather than falling through to the streamed reasoning prose. `StructuredOutputError` (the model did not call the StructuredOutput tool after those retries) keeps its own wording including the retry count. A failed turn is retried only when opencode marks it retryable and the turn ran no tools: a provider blip that kills the turn before the model acts costs a retry, while a request the provider rejected as invalid fails immediately with an actionable message, and a turn that already invoked a tool is never repeated because each attempt runs in a fresh session and would replay that tool's side effects. When native structured output is genuinely absent, it falls back to the common text fallback described above while allowing `null` for optional fields.

## Pi

Spawns a `pi` subprocess for each invocation with `--mode json`. Cold invocations add `--no-session`; with `session_reuse: true`, review-fixer turns instead create and resume one Pi session per run via `--session <UUID>`.
Model and reasoning effort come from [`agent_config.pi`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config), rendered as `--model` and `--thinking`. See [`agent_args_override`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_args_override) for Pi override precedence.
Reads JSONL events from stdout and streams incremental text deltas to the TUI.
When structured output is requested, no-mistakes injects the JSON schema into the prompt and validates the final text response with the common text fallback described above.

## Copilot CLI

Spawns a `copilot` subprocess for each invocation with `-p <prompt> --output-format json`.
It also adds `--no-color` and `--no-ask-user` so the run is non-interactive, plus `--allow-all-tools` (required for non-interactive mode) unless you already set your own Copilot permission flag through `agent_args_override`.
Any `agent_args_override.copilot` flags are inserted before no-mistakes' managed flags, so user choices take effect. Prefer [`agent_config.copilot`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config) for model and reasoning effort; it renders the same `--model` and `--effort` flags, and a raw flag here still wins over it.
Reads JSONL events from stdout, streaming incremental `assistant.message_delta` text to the TUI and capturing the final `assistant.message` content.
The Copilot CLI has no output-schema flag, so when structured output is requested no-mistakes injects the JSON schema into the prompt and validates the final text response with the common text fallback described above.

## Jcode

Spawns a `jcode` subprocess for each invocation with `run --ndjson --quiet --no-update --no-selfdev`, delivering the prompt as the final positional after a `--` separator.
Under `disable_project_settings: true`, jcode launches with `JCODE_NO_AGENTS_MD=1`: the env knob suppresses both the checkout's `./AGENTS.md` and the global `~/AGENTS.md` before any path check, so the target repository cannot install a governing identity on a gate agent (see [`disable_project_settings`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#disable_project_settings)). `jcode run` has no CLI flag that re-enables AGENTS.md loading, so an operator `agent_args_override` cannot defeat it.
Any `agent_args_override.jcode` flags are inserted between the `run` subcommand and no-mistakes' managed flags, so operator choices such as `-m <model>` take effect; `jcode model list` prints the accepted model names.
`jcode run` has no `--effort` flag, so no-mistakes accepts a managed `--effort <level>` pseudo-flag in `agent_args_override.jcode` and per-step profiles and translates it into the `JCODE_ANTHROPIC_REASONING_EFFORT` / `JCODE_OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT` environment variables jcode reads for reasoning depth; the pseudo-flag never reaches argv.
When no effort is configured, jcode invocations run at `low` effort, matching the old claude-era pipeline override (`agent_args_override.claude: --effort low`); pin `--effort high` (or `--effort default` to restore jcode's model default) when a step needs more depth.
Because the command line is rebuilt on every invocation, `jcode` is a first-class per-step target in [`agent_args_override_per_step`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_args_override_per_step), unlike the ACP bridge which cannot express per-invocation flags.
Reads NDJSON events from stdout, streaming incremental `text_delta` text to the TUI, summing the per-round `tokens` events for usage, and capturing the final `done` text.
The `run` subcommand has no output-schema flag, so when structured output is requested no-mistakes injects the JSON schema into the prompt and validates the final text response with the same JSON fence and bare-object fallback used by Pi and Copilot.
For review-loop reuse, Jcode resumes the reported `session_id` with `jcode run --resume <id>`, so the reviewer and fixer keep role-isolated durable sessions.

## ACP aliases

ACP aliases are first-class agent names that resolve to ACP targets.
`agent: cursor` is the first alias: it is shorthand for the `cursor` ACP target with the default raw command `cursor-agent acp`, not a separate native backend.
`agent: acp:cursor` uses that same default command, so either spelling works without an `acp_registry_overrides.cursor` entry.

Because aliases still run through acpx, they use `acpx_path` for the bridge binary and share the same ACP prompt and structured-output behavior as `agent: acp:<target>`.
Unlike arbitrary `acp:<target>` entries, aliases may participate in `agent: auto` when their availability checks pass.
The [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/) owns ACP availability, bridge-path, command-override, and equivalent-spelling deduplication rules.

## ACP via acpx

ACP support is optional and requires a separately installed `acpx` binary.
Use `agent: acp:<target>` to run a target known to acpx, for example `agent: acp:gemini`.
When the target matches a first-class alias such as `acp:cursor`, no-mistakes supplies that alias' default raw command.
Configure custom target commands in the [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#acp_registry_overrides).

no-mistakes invokes acpx with JSON output, approve-all permissions, denied non-interactive permission prompts, and the repo worktree as `--cwd`.
Structured output is handled by appending the requested JSON schema to the prompt and validating the final assistant text with the common text fallback described above.
A `model` set under [`agent_config`](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#agent_config) for an alias or `acp:<target>` is passed as acpx's own `--model`, so ACP targets can be pinned to an explicit model. acpx exposes no reasoning-effort surface, so `effort` is refused for ACP names rather than silently ignored.

## Checking agent availability

Run `no-mistakes doctor` to inspect individual native and ACP runner binaries and to check the effective global agent configuration:

```
$ no-mistakes doctor
  ✓ git
  ✓ gh
  ✓ data directory
  ✓ database
  ✓ daemon running
  ✓ claude
  – codex (not found)
  – grok (not found)
  – rovodev (not found)
  – opencode (not found)
  – pi (not found)
  – copilot (not found)
  – antigravity (not found)
  – acpx (not found)
  – cursor (not found (cursor-agent, acpx))
  ✓ gate validation claude is runnable
```

`✓` = available, `–` = not found (optional), `✗` = problem detected.
The standalone `acpx` and `cursor` rows inspect the default binary names.
The `gate validation` line is the decisive result: when the configured global runner is unavailable, doctor fails because a complete gate cannot validate without it.
See the [Global Config Reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/) for ACP availability and probing behavior.
Every new validation run resolves its effective agent again after applying any trusted repository-level override.
