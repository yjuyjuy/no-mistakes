title: Auto-Fix Loop
description: How the automatic fix loop works.
---

When a pipeline step finds issues, `no-mistakes` can automatically ask the agent to fix them before pausing for your approval. This is controlled by the `auto_fix` configuration.

  run["Run step"] --> findings{"Findings?"}
  findings -- "no" --> done["Step completes"]
  findings -- "yes" --> eligible{"Auto-fix enabled and eligible findings?"}
  eligible -- "no" --> pause["Pause for user approval"]
  eligible -- "yes" --> fix["Agent applies fixes"]
  fix --> rerun["Re-run step"]
  rerun --> clean{"Blocking findings remain?"}
  clean -- "no" --> done
  clean -- "yes, attempts left" --> eligible
  clean -- "yes, limit hit" --> pause
```

## How it works

1. A step executes and returns findings (e.g., test failures, lint warnings, review issues)
2. If `auto_fix` is enabled for that step (limit > 0) and the attempt count is below the limit, the executor re-runs the step with `fixing=true`
3. The agent receives the previous findings and applies fixes
4. The step re-runs to verify the fixes
5. If issues remain and attempts are left, the loop continues
6. Once the limit is reached or all issues are resolved:
   - If issues remain, the step pauses for user approval
   - If everything passes, the step completes and the pipeline moves on

The document step applies fixes during its initial pass instead of relying on a follow-up automatic fix loop.
When `commands.lint` is empty, that same invocation is a combined documentation-and-lint housekeeping pass: it updates documentation, detects relevant linters and formatters, applies safe fixes, verifies both duties, and categorizes any unresolved findings for the document or lint gate.
The lint step consumes a usable lint result from that pass instead of starting a second cold agent invocation; when the combined pass is skipped, cannot produce trustworthy structured output, or loses its in-memory result across a daemon restart, lint falls back to its own agent pass.
Unresolved documentation findings and unresolved blocking lint findings pause for approval instead of entering another automatic fix loop.

## Before the agent: deterministic CI reruns

The CI step has one cheaper option than a fix round, and it tries it first.

A check whose failure the provider attributes to itself rather than to your commit, such as a cancellation, is the provider telling you about itself. On GitHub, a positive transient rerun budget also enables structural detection of jobs that failed before any repository step ran. Handing a detected provider failure to the fix agent spends an agent round reading a run that never tested anything, and the fix it invents edits code that was never broken. So when every terminally failed check on the pull request is one of those and the configured budget authorizes a rerun, the CI step asks the provider to run those checks again for the same commit and keeps polling.

That deterministic rerun sits strictly before the agent rounds described above:

1. Every check finishes and at least one has failed.
2. If all of those failures are provider-attributed checks, the pull request has no merge conflict, and the configured budget authorizes it, each one is re-run and the monitor keeps polling. No `auto_fix.ci` attempt is consumed.
3. When such a detected provider-attributed outcome is the only remaining issue, a check with no authorized or outstanding rerun pauses for a decision without consuming an `auto_fix.ci` attempt.
4. Every other failure escalates into the `auto_fix.ci` loop on its first observation.

[`ci.rerun_transient`](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#cirerun_transient) owns the budget, the exact classification, and every case that skips the rerun.

Nothing that survives a rerun falls into the agent loop either. A check the provider cancels again, or a detected GitHub setup failure that persists after its budget, is still not a verdict on the code, so it pauses for a decision instead of spending a fix round on a run that never tested anything. A cancellation no rerun is going to replace, including at the default budget of `0`, reaches that same decision directly: the provider has published its conclusion and will not replace it, so waiting on it would never end. A rerun costs another provider-side workflow run, so the budget is deliberately small and is spent when the rerun is requested, which bounds the loop by construction. Each rerun is announced in the step log, so a run that is waiting on one says so instead of looking stalled. Reruns never cross a head change: if the published branch head no longer matches the commit the run delivered, the step pauses with the expected and observed commits rather than re-running checks against a revision it never produced.

## Configuration

Per-step attempt limits come from the `auto_fix` config object; the [`auto_fix` field reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#auto_fix) owns the defaults, per-step meanings, and the legacy alias.
Setting a step to `0` disables the follow-up auto-fix loop, so the pipeline pauses for human input when that step finds issues; `auto_fix.review` defaults to `0`, so review findings require manual approval unless you opt in.
Repo config overlays global config field by field - you can set `auto_fix.lint: 5` in a repo's `.no-mistakes.yaml` to override just that step while inheriting the rest from global.

## Finding actions

Agent-driven findings now use an `action` field instead of `requires_human_review`:

- `auto-fix` - objective issues that can be fixed automatically
- `ask-user` - intent-sensitive or ambiguous issues that pause for approval instead of entering the normal auto-fix loop
- `no-op` - informational notes that do not need a fix

If an agent or integration omits `action`, no-mistakes fails closed by treating the finding as `ask-user`.
An unclassified finding is never eligible for automatic fixing.

`ask-user` is meant for findings that need human judgment - for example, questioning an intentional product or design choice, arguing that an intentional addition, removal, or guard should be undone, or reporting that the test step could not produce enough evidence for the available intent. Routine correctness, reliability, or security fixes still stay `auto-fix` even if the smallest fix reintroduces a small amount of previously deleted logic. Agents driving the AXI skill should relay `ask-user` findings to the user unless they have explicit `--yes` consent to resolve gates unattended.
In the TUI, yolo mode is an explicit override that auto-resolves paused steps by treating `auto-fix` and `ask-user` findings as consent to run one fix round.
Steps with only `no-op` findings are approved as-is.

The `review`, `test`, and configured-command `lint` steps use this shared model directly. The `document` step also uses the same `action` field, but unresolved documentation findings pause for approval because the initial document pass already attempted the documentation updates it could make safely.
When `commands.lint` is empty, the combined housekeeping pass routes documentation and lint findings to their owning gates. Its unresolved lint findings describe issues left after safe fixes, so blocking findings pause for approval instead of remaining eligible for another automatic fix loop.

Documentation findings use the same approval UI, but the `document` step treats any finding as an unresolved documentation gap or judgment call that should pause for approval.

## User-triggered fixes

When the pipeline pauses for approval, you can manually trigger a fix from the TUI or AXI interface:

1. The findings panel shows all findings with checkboxes
2. Toggle individual findings with `space`, or use `A` (all) / `N` (none)
3. Optionally press `e` to attach a note to the current finding, or `+` to add your own finding to the fix request
4. Press `f` to fix the selected findings

The agent receives the merged fix payload for that round: the selected agent findings, any per-finding user notes, any selected user-authored findings added from the TUI or AXI interface, and the shared [finding decision history](/no-mistakes/reference/pipeline-steps/#finding-decision-history).
The current step's part of that history also includes one-line summaries from earlier fix commits.

After a user-triggered fix, the step re-runs and pauses again to show you the results (`fix_review` status). You can then approve, fix again, skip, or abort.
Yolo and AXI `--yes` approve that fix review automatically after their one fix round, so a finding that remains after the fix does not trigger an unbounded fix loop.

## Fix commits

When the Review, Test, Document, Lint, or CI step commits auto-fix changes, its subject comes from `commit.fix_message`.
The [global config reference](/no-mistakes/reference/global-config/#commitfix_message) owns the template syntax, default, validation rules, size limits, and supported placeholders; the [repo config reference](/no-mistakes/reference/repo-config/#commitfix_message) owns the repository override and trust behavior.
The pipeline validates the template, agent summary, predicted output size, and final rendered subject before `git add -A`, so a rejected value does not leave changes staged.
The combined document-and-lint housekeeping pass runs in the Document step, so its documentation and safe lint fixes use the Document value for `{{.Step}}`; configured-command lint fixes use the Lint value.

Before a step-specific fix commit, the pipeline verifies that the live worktree HEAD still descends from the head recorded after its previous commit.
It allows a legitimate forward commit made by an agent, but aborts the run if an out-of-band backward or divergent reset would drop the reviewed history.

The template does not control commits created by the Rebase or Push steps.
The Push step uses `no-mistakes: apply agent fixes` for remaining uncommitted changes.

## Step rounds

Each execution of a step (initial run or follow-up auto-fix run) is recorded as a "round" in the database.
A round stores its findings, duration, any selected finding IDs and whether that selection came from the user or auto-fix filtering, the merged finding payload actually sent to the fix agent for that round, and any one-line fix summary from that execution.
That merged payload can include per-finding user notes and user-authored findings added from the TUI or AXI interface.
AXI status uses the same round history and the persisted auto-fix limit to show the active fix attempt, for example `auto-fix 1/3` or `fix 2`.
The step log records a marker when each automatic or user-triggered fix round starts.
The generated PR surfaces this recorded evidence in deterministic Risk Assessment, Testing, and Pipeline sections. The [pipeline steps reference](/no-mistakes/reference/pipeline-steps/#pr) owns the PR body composition and size-limit contract.
The full round history remains available in the run log.

Round trigger types:
- `initial` - first execution
- `auto_fix` - triggered by the automatic fix loop
- `auto_fix` - also used when you press `f` in the TUI or use `no-mistakes axi respond --action fix` to run a follow-up fix

Legacy `user_fix` rounds are still rendered as `auto-fix` in PR summaries for backward compatibility.
