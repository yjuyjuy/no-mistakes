# collect it. Cases of the same repository share one local object pool, so a
# case costs its own records plus the objects its commits introduced - not a
# copy of the repository. max_cases bounds the corpus: the oldest cases are
# dropped first, and a case that already has recorded replays is never dropped.
# Set max_cases to 0 to keep every case. diversified_size caps the official
