// legacyEvidenceDirName is the fixed directory no-mistakes used to create
// directly inside the system temp directory. It was never reaped by anything in
// this program: on Linux the daemon's TMPDIR is unset, so it resolved to the
// shared /tmp - a RAM-backed tmpfs on current Ubuntu - and it accumulated one
// subdirectory per run until an OS timer or a reboot happened to clear it.
//
// Evidence now lives under the app root (paths.EvidenceDir). This name survives
// only so an upgraded daemon drains what earlier versions left behind, under
// the same retention policy and the same active-run guard. Delete this constant
// and reapLegacyEvidence once installs from before the relocation are gone.

// Three rules, applied oldest-first and all best effort:
//
//  1. An empty run directory is removed regardless of age. The test step
//     creates the directory before the agent decides whether it has anything to
//     write, so a run that produced no artifact would otherwise leave a
//     permanent entry behind. Nearly all of the observed accumulation was this.
//  2. A run directory older than the retention window is removed.
//  3. Whatever survives is trimmed to the run ceiling, oldest first.
//
// A directory whose run row is still pending or running is never touched, at
// any step - the same active-run guard cleanupOrphanWorktrees uses, for the
// same reason: only a settled run's leftovers are safe to remove.
