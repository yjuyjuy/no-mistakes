// is what makes this correct across rebases: a clean rebase rewrites commit

// Excluding baseSHA's ancestors (^baseSHA) is what lets a force push legitimately
// rewrite history the gate already knew - the common amend, or reverting the
// pipeline's own prior autofix commit - without flagging it as data loss, while
// still catching a commit that reached the branch out of band (which, having
// arrived after the run's base, is never an ancestor of baseSHA). baseSHA is
