// Package cimonitor is the single source of truth for the CI monitor's
// human-facing log vocabulary and agent-facing monitoring state.
//
// The CI step (internal/pipeline/steps) emits these exact log lines while it
// watches an open PR. Two very different consumers read them back: the TUI
// renders a live CI panel, and the agent-facing `axi` commands decide when to
// hand control back to the agent. Keeping the strings and the parser here means
// both consumers interpret a run identically and cannot drift apart.
//
// Readiness ownership is split deliberately: the pipeline/config owner decides
// whether a trusted default-branch `no_ci: true` declaration applies, and this
// package combines that authoritative state with the activity log for consumers.
