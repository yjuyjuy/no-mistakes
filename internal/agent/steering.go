// independently of the test step - two copies of one fact, either of which
// could move without the other. The caller owns the path; this owns the wording.

- Confine source, project, user-data, and system file changes to the current working directory, which is a git worktree. Do not intentionally create, modify, move, or delete those files anywhere outside it.
- Do not modify system state outside the worktree. In particular, do not install or upgrade system packages (for example brew install/upgrade, or other system package managers), do not modify applications under /Applications, and do not change global or user-level tool configuration.
- This is prompt steering, not true enforcement: treat the worktree boundary as a soft boundary you must follow.
- The only allowed out-of-worktree writes are test evidence files under %s when a testing prompt explicitly asks for them.
- Ephemeral temp/cache writes that are incidental side effects of running the project development toolchain are allowed outside the worktree for tests, linters, formatters, builds, and manual verification commands.
- You may read files outside the worktree and run read-only commands, but every other intentional write must stay inside the worktree.
